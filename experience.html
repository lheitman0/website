        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>I discovered a market inefficiency between the EU and US for vintage Land Rover Defenders created by the 1996 U.S. Safety Act. By handling sellers and EU-to-US logistics and forming a Montana LLC to cut registration costs, I flipped two Defenders for a 16% net gain. Capital capped scale and identified tweaks could raise margins another ~ 20%.</p>
